Options for Installing Software Regardless of how you are accessing the software for this class, there are two options for installing the core applications R and RStudio as well as their associated dependencies. The first option is to use a virtual installation of R and RStudio. This uses an application called Docker to create a virtual instance of R and RStudio that you can access via your browser.</description>
